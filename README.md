# LogicSquare

this is the game term-project which is made by **python(cocos2d library)**

I was inspired of 'Nonogram' game which is made by Japanese developer. This game has really easy rules.


## Rules
1. The number which is located on the top of the board means that the number of squares to be painted consecutively.
2. When several numbers are together, at least one unpainted square must exist between the painted squares.
3. If you think that you can't paint the square, you can makr 'X' by clicking the right-mouse button on that square.
4. If you want to paint the square, click the left-mouse button.

When all squares to be painted are painted, one round is cleared. After you clear 3 rounds, you can go to the Logic's Castle.(Boss room) Kill a Logic's Castle's dragon, and be a hero!
- from How to play


Whenever you finish each round, you can get a item which needs to kill the dragon. If you need a hint, look up to the left. Hint is related to the shape to be made.

And if you click the wrong button, you lose 5 seconds. Be careful of the time-out.
